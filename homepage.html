    <p>The coronavirus pandemic is upending life on a global level as we know it. The highly infectious coronavirus
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was first
      seen in Wuhan, Hubei, China where its outbreak was first identified in December 2019. After almost 3 months, on
      March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization recognized it as a pandemic considering its significant ongoing
      spread in multiple countries across the world.</p>
    <p>While on one hand people across India and around the globe are largely confined to their homes with businesses
      and educational institutions all shut down in an attempt to contain the virus, and on the other hand doctors,
      health-care workers, and medical staff members are leading the battle against COVID-19 from the front. Putting
      their own lives at risk with selfless determination for the sake of saving lives, they truly are our heroes in
      these challenging times. While they are putting their own health, families, and most importantly their own lives
      at risk, the least we can do is appreciate their efforts and cooperate by staying safe indoors.</p>

    <h2>Doctors, Health-care Workers and Fight against COVID-19</h2>
    <p>Needless to say, doctors, nurses and people working in health-care sectors are particularly vulnerable to the
      highly infectious disease. In response to the global pandemic, the under-resourced doctors are facing
      unprecedented challenges. The list of the sleep-deprived heroes includes doctors, nurses, medical cleaners,
      pathologists, paramedics, ambulance drivers, and health-care administrators. In the fight against coronavirus,
      the
      brave medical army stands strong with thermometers, stethoscopes, and ventilators as their weapons. Not to
      forget,
      medical researchers are working day in and night out against all odds, hoping to find the antidote to the
      disease.
    </p>
    <p>Since the coronavirus outbreak, health-care professionals have not only experienced the gratification of
      healing
      patients and saving their lives but have also lost many battles along the way. On top of that, many doctors have
      even sacrificed their own lives in the line of duty.
    </p>
    <p>Every day, the selfless warriors are giving it their all in health-care settings while cutting themselves off
      from their families and loved ones. The sacrifice that they are making for the safety and welfare of humanity is
      priceless and deserves lifelong gratitude on our end. Most importantly, we must reassess the value health-care
      workers hold in our lives and the kind of treatment they get from us. Among the several lessons this coronavirus
      pandemic has been teaching us, the biggest one is to find ways to sufficiently invest in the better and more
      efficient medical fraternity and give medical professionals the respect, compensation and infrastructure that
      they truly deserve once this crisis is over. Moreover, the world needs to work towards advancement in medical
      research and technology. Nothing will be a greater tribute to the health-care workers than this.</p>
